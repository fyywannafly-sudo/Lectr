## 📖 What is Lectr?

Lectr is a desktop program that lets you write and edit Markdown files easily. Markdown is a simple way to add formatting, like headings and lists, to plain text. With Lectr, you can see your Markdown work update instantly as you type. The app supports tabs so you can work on many files at once. It runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS computers.

Lectr also speaks both English and Russian, making it easier to use for people who prefer either language. It is built on Electron, which means it works as a standalone app and does not need any programming tools installed.
